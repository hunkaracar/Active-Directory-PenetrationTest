## Reconnaissance

In this section, the target network is scanned to identify open ports and running services using Nmap commands.

## Msfconsole

Various modules and attacks targeting SMB and Active Directory are carried out using the Metasploit Framework Console. This is used for vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

## Enum4linux

Enum4linux is a tool used to target SMB services on the network. It is used to gather information about users, shares, and other SMB-related information on the target system.

## Folder Enumeration

Commands used to list shares and directories on the target system over SMB. This helps in identifying accessible resources on the target system.

## Users Detection and Enumeration

Tools and commands used to detect users and gather more information about them. This is used to collect usernames and information related to users.

## Connecting to the System Remotely

Commands and tools used to establish remote access to target systems. This provides the ability to run commands and gain access to remote systems.

## Capture All Hashes

Tools and commands used to capture password hashes of the target system. This is helpful for password cracking attacks.

## Pass the Hash Attack

Techniques used to gain access to target systems using captured password hashes instead of actual passwords.
